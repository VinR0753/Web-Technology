How does internet works?

Network
Collection/System of interconnected devices that can exchange data and store, share resources with each other.
These networking devices use a system of rules called Communication protocols io transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.

Topologies
    Bus
        Consists of central line to which devices are connected.
        Limitations
            Any breakage to line breaks the network
    
    Ring
        Every device is connected to adjacent device forming a Ring
        Limitations
            Damage to line breaks the network.
            Lot of unnecessary calls being made.
    
    Star
        All devices are connected to central device/hub
        Limitations
            If hub fails,the whole network fails
    
    Tree
        Combination of bus and star Topologies
        More fall tolerance
    
    Mesh
        Every single computer is connected to every other computer
        Limitations
            Expensive
            Scalability issue

Types of Networks
    PAN(Personal Area Network)
        PAN is a computer network used for data transmission amongst devices such as computers, telephones, tablets and personal digital assistance.
        Also known as HAN(Home Area Network)

    LAN(Local Area Network)
        LANs are widely used to connect computers, laptops & consumer electronics which enable them to share resources and exchange info when used by companies or organization
        There are 2 different types of LAN
            Wired LAN
            Wireless LAN
    
    MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)
        It connects and covers the whole city

    WAN(Wide Area Network)
        It spans over a large geographical area, often a country or continent
    
    GAN(Global Area Network)
        Internet that connects globe using satellites.

   What are Wireless Networks?
            Networks that are not connected by cables.
            Generally use radio waves to communicate
            Advantages
                Easy installation
                Wider reach
                Access and availability
                Flexibility
                Cost Saving

    VPN(Virtual Private Network)
        It is a private WAN which allows creation of secure tunnel (protected network) between different networks using the internet (public network).
        By using VPN clients can connect to the organization remotely.
        VPN encrypts the internet traffic and the online identity.
        It keeps all the information secured against any potential threats.
        Advantages
            Secure network
            Hides private information
            Prevents data throttling!?      // ISP deliberately restricting internet bandwidth or speed 
            Cost Effective Security
            Scalability

Problem with IP packets transmission
    May arrive out of order
    Become corrupted
    Dropped or lost during transmission

To solve this we have
    TCP(Transmission Control protocol)
        Solves all 3 problems 
        Small delay
        Used  for text, images
        Features

        Used for voicemail, video conference
        DNS

Other Protocols
    DHCP(Dynamic Host CConfiguration Protocol)
        Used to assign IP address to computer
        Uses DHCP server

    HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
        Core operational protocol - used to communicate with web servers.
        Uses TCP(Transfer layer)
        Works on request response model
        STATELESS(state is not saved on server - uses cookies)

    HTTPs(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol secure)
        Encrypted

    DNS Protocol(Domain Name System Protocol)
        Gives IP address of website from DNS server

    IMAP(Internet Message Access Protocol)
        Used to download emails and manage mailbox
