Spring Framework
    Framework
        It is a set of pre defined code or methods which provides base or structure to develop application i.e instead of starting from scratch it provides us a platform to build software

    Spring Framework
        Spring is a light weight powerful java framework used to develop enterprise application

    History
        By Rod Johnson in 2003 - Vmware

    Features of Spring
        It is a lightweight powerful java framework used to develop enterprise application
        Supports POJO classes - doesn't force to inherit from any classes or interface
        It is called framework of frameworks - it uses existing frameworks - provides shortcuts for already existing frameworks
        It is developer friendly
        It supports Aspect oriented programming - solves cross-cutting programming
        It provides dependency injection which helps to achieve loose coupling
        It supports model

Spring Core/Spring IOC (Inversion of Control)
    Inversion of Control
        THe process of transferring the control of life cycle management of an object to a framework

    IOC Container
     there are two types of container
        Core container
        Advanced/EJB(Enterprise java bean) container   

                            Bean Factory i

                xml bean factory c              Application context i
                
                                 ClassPath xml c FileSystem xml c ApplicationConfig c

Bean
    It is object which is created by spring

Bean attributes
    lazy loading - object will be created when we call or invoke
    eager loading - object will be created even if we do not call
    init method - method will be called when the object is created
    destroy method
    scope
        singleton(default)
        prototype
        request
        session
        global session

    Bean Factory                                                        Application factory
    it is an interface called as core container                         It is an interface called Advanced/EJB Container
    Package org.springframework.beansfactory                            Package org.springframework.Context
    Here we have have to create object for class path resource          No need to create class path object
    It is lazy loading- object is created only when object is called    It is eager loading
    It doesn't support annotation                                       Supports both xml and annotation

Steps
    Creating object
    Value injection
        Setter injection
        Constructor injection
    Dependency injection
        Setter injection
        Constructor injection
        Method injection

        Setter injection                                    Constructor injection
It uses setters to inject values                        It uses constructor to inject values
Here we use <property> tag                              Here we use <constructors-arg>
    name:"",value:"",ref:""                                 index="",values="",ref=""
First object is created and later values will be set    values will be set while creating the object
Can be partially injected                               It is compulsory to inject all values

Dependency injection
    Externally injecting one class object into another class

Annotation
    One of the java types
